Hello there. My name is Jakob and I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow in the [group of
Ami Bhatt](https://www.bhattlab.com/) at the Stanford University School of 
Medicine. In my work, I use computational tools to investigate how the
microbiome contributes to human health and disease, especially in the context
of cancer. 

I obtained my PhD after working in the [group of Georg 
Zeller](https://zellerlab.org/) at the 
European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg. My research there
focussed on statistical methods and machine learning tools for microbiome data. 
During my PhD, I helped to develop the __[SIAMCAT R 
package](https://github.com/zellerlab/siamcat)__, a versatile toolbox for
machine learning-based comparative metagenomic analyses. Another project of
mine investigated the connection between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer,
where we performed a __[meta-analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0406-6)__ 
to evaluate how consistent microbiome-disease associations are across 
different datasets. The last project of my PhD was a [benchmark for association testing 
methods](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-024-03390-9) 
in microbiome data. We developed a framework to generate realistic data sets for
benchmarking and evaluated various association testing methods, including 
simulated settings of confounding.
