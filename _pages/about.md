Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the Zeller team at EMBL Heidelberg. In our
group, we focus on computational tools and analysis strategies to investigate
how the microbiome contributes to human health and disease and how it is shaped
by host factors such as nutrition and drug intake.

My research involves method development and applying machine learning methods
to microbiome data. For example, I have been heavily involved in the development of the
__[SIAMCAT](https://github.com/zellerlab/siamcat) R package__ (_and I am always
happy to help with questions/bugs/feature-requests -  just drop me an
[email](mailto:jakob.wirbel@embl.de) or
[open an issue](https://github.com/zellerlab/siamcat/issues/new)
in the Github repository_), which can be used to analyse __associations between
the microbiome and host phenotypes__ (such as disease status, for example).   
Another project of mine focusses on the connection between the __gut
microbiome and colorectal cancer__. Several studies have already been published
in this field, so that the amount of publicly available data warrants a
__meta-analysis__. Here, the question I try to answer is how consistent are
microbiome-disease associations across different datasets and how well can a
model trained on one dataset be transferred to another dataset.

Outside of the lab I can be found mostly in the __bouldering gym__ in
Heidelberg or somewhere outdoors. Furthermore, some friends and I are trying
to brew __our own beers__ at home, including two successful pale
ales, an interesting stout, and one questionable lager so far.   
I am reading mostly __sci-fi and fantasy__ literature (especially from
[Alastair Reynolds](http://www.alastairreynolds.com/); if you don't know him,
go and check out his books...) and am a fervent listener of all kinds of
good __podcasts__, for example
[99 percent invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/),
[radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab),
[no such thing as a fish](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/), or
[the allusionist](https://www.theallusionist.org/), to name just a few.
