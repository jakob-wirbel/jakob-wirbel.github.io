Hi there. I am Jakob and I am currently a Postdoctoral fellow in the [group of
Ami Bhatt](https://www.bhattlab.com/) at the Stanford University School of 
Medicine. In my work, I use computational tools to investigate how the
microbiome contributes to human health and disease, especially in the context
of cancer. 

I obtained my PhD after working in the [group of Georg 
Zeller](https://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/zeller/) at the 
European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg. My research there
involved applying machine learning methods to microbiome data. For example,
I helped to develop the __[SIAMCAT R 
package](https://github.com/zellerlab/siamcat)__, a versatile toolbox for
machine learning-based comparative metagenomic analyses. Another project of
mine focused on the connection between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer,
where we performed a __[meta-analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0406-6)__ 
to evaluate how consistent microbiome-disease associations are across 
different datasets.

Outside of the lab I enjoy everything outdoors, such as hiking, biking, or
bouldering. I recently also discovered baking as a hobby and am reading 
mostly sci-fi and fantasy literature (especially from 
[Alastair Reynolds](http://www.alastairreynolds.com/)).
