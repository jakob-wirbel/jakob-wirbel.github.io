The gastrointestinal tract is abundantly colonized by microbes, yet the
translocation of oral species to the intestine is considered a rare aberrant
event, and a hallmark of disease. By studying salivary and fecal microbial
strain populations of 310 species in 470 individuals from five countries, we
found that transmission to, and subsequent colonization of, the large
intestine by oral microbes is common and extensive among healthy individuals.
We found evidence for a vast majority of oral species to be transferable,
with increased levels of transmission in colorectal cancer and rheumatoid
arthritis patients and, more generally, for species described as opportunistic
pathogens. This establishes the oral cavity as an endogenous reservoir for
gut microbial strains, and oral-fecal transmission as an important process
that shapes the gastrointestinal microbiome in health and disease.
